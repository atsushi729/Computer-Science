## Data Link layer
### CSMA/CD
A Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) is the one of the way to communicate method used by Ethernet.
This method is used to avoid collision data. Before send data to another computer, CSMA/CD will check wether data is sending on wire or not.
If data is not sending or existing data, then computer can send data to another computer.

### MAC address
A media access control address (MAC address) is a unique identifier to an individual network interface. MAC address is a 48-bit number usually denoted by six groupings of two hexadecimal number.
note : MAC address is globally unique.

### Data packet
A data packet is a unit of data made into a single package which is being sent across a network link.
Data packets are used in Internet Protocol (IP) transmissions for data that navigates the Web, and in other kinds of networks.


* Unicast transmission is used when one device transmits data to another device. A unicast transmission is always meant for just one receiving address.
* Multicast transmission is used when one device send data to multiple devices.
* Broadcast transmission is used when one device sends data to every device on a LAN.

### Subnet
A subnet, or subnetwork, is a smaller network that is created within a larger network. It is used to divide the larger network into smaller, more manageable groups. This can be useful for a variety of reasons, such as improving network performance, security, and organization.

In a subnet, devices are connected to each other and can communicate with each other directly, without the need to go through a router or other external device. Each subnet has its own unique range of IP addresses, which are used to identify the devices on the subnet.

Subnets are often used in large organizations that have multiple locations or departments, as they can be used to create separate networks for each location or department. This can help to ensure that network traffic is kept separate and secure, and can also make it easier to manage and troubleshoot network issues.
