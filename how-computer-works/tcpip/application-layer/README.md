## What is the responsible Application layer
The application layer is responsible for providing services to the user and application processes that need to communicate with other systems. It is the layer that is closest to the user and is responsible for providing the interface between the user and the network.

Examples of application layer protocols include HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), FTP (File Transfer Protocol), SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), and DNS (Domain Name System). These protocols enable communication between different applications and facilitate the exchange of data between them.

## What is FTP
File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard network protocol used to transfer files from one host to another over a TCP-based network, such as the internet. FTP is a client-server protocol, which means that an FTP client, such as a web browser or a command-line tool, sends a request to an FTP server, and the server responds with the requested data or an error message.

FTP is typically used to transfer large files or groups of files from one computer to another, such as transferring website files from a local computer to a web server. It is also commonly used to download files from servers, such as software packages or media files.

FTP uses separate connections for control and data transfer, which allows the client and server to exchange commands and data simultaneously. FTP also supports various file transfer modes, such as ASCII mode for transferring text files and binary mode for transferring non-text files.
