## What is Ethernet
Ethernet is a type of computer networking technology that is used to connect devices to a local area network (LAN). It was first developed in the 1970s and has since become one of the most widely used networking technologies in the world.

Ethernet uses a protocol called the Ethernet Frame to send data between devices. The Ethernet Frame consists of a header, which contains information about the source and destination of the data, and a payload, which contains the actual data being transmitted. Ethernet devices use unique MAC addresses to identify themselves on the network.

Ethernet supports a variety of different speeds, including 10Mbps, 100Mbps, and 1Gbps. It is commonly used in both wired and wireless networks, and is the primary means of communication for many devices, such as computers, routers, and switches.
