# Graph
## What is graph
Graph is a discrete structure which consist of node(vertices) and edges connecting them.

### Definition of Vertex
vertex is basic element of a graph and which can be drawn as node or dot.<br>
Set of vertices of G is usually denoted by V(G) or V

e.g.<br>
V(G) = {v1, v2, v3}


### Definition of Edges
It is a like between 2 vertices, and it can be drawn as a line connection two vertices.<br>
The set of edges in a graph G is usually denoted by E(G) or E.<br>
e.g.<br>
E(G) = {e1, e2} = {{v1, v2}, {v2, v3}}
