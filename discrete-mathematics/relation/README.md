# Relation
## What is relation
***
Relations may exist between objects of the same set or between objects of two or more sets.

### Reflexivity
Reflexive relation is a relation of elements of a set A such that each element of the set is related to itself.
> R is reflexive if for all x ∈ A, xRx (relate itself)

### Symmetry
> R is symmetric if for all x,y ∈ A, if xRy, then yRx
### Anti-symmetry
> R is antisymmetric on a set S if for all x ∈ S and for all y ∈ S, if (x, y) R (y, x) R ∈ , then x = y
### Transitivity
A relation R on set S is called transitive if and only if xRy and yRz implies xRz,∀x,y,z∈A
> The relation R={(1,2),(2,3),(1,3)} on set A={1,2,3} is transitive.

### Equivalence relation
R is an equivalence relation if A is nonempty and R is reflexive, symmetric and transitive.

### Partial order
R is an equivalence relation if A is nonempty and R is reflexive, antisymmetric and transitive.
