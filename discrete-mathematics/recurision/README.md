# What is Recursive?
recursion refers to the process of defining a function or sequence in terms of itself. <br>
This is often done by defining a base case and a recursive case, where the function or sequence is defined in terms of itself for input values greater than the base case, and the base case is used for input values equal to or less than the base case. <br>
For example, the Fibonacci sequence is defined recursively, where the nth number in the sequence is the sum of the (n-1)th and (n-2)th numbers in the sequence.<br>
